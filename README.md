# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Input Validation and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient input validation and error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## The Problem

The original code attempts to fetch user details using a user ID from the request parameters.  However, it lacks:

1. **Input Validation:** It doesn't check if the `userId` is a valid number. If a non-numeric ID is provided, it can lead to database query errors or unexpected results.
2. **Error Handling:** The code does not gracefully handle potential errors during database queries (e.g., connection failures, query execution errors).  If an error occurs, the application will likely crash.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses these issues by:

1. **Validating Input:** It verifies that the `userId` is a valid number using `isNaN()`.
2. **Handling Errors:** It uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors from the database query and sends an appropriate error response.

This example emphasizes the importance of robust error handling and input validation in building secure and reliable Express.js applications.
