const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // ... some database query to fetch user details using userId ...
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  }
  res.send(user);
});

//Problem: If userId is not a number, this code will throw an error because it's treated as a string in the database query.  This is especially relevant for user-supplied IDs, where you cannot always be sure the format is correct.
//Another potential problem is that this route handler does not handle errors thrown by the database query.  If the database connection fails or another error happens during query execution, this route will crash without a proper response.
